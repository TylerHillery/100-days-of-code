# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--- This what was oringally in the log file. I am going to keep it as a reference for markdown syntax.
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: Monday January 3rd 2021

**Today's Progress**: I went through the SQL & Python exercises on W3Schools. I also checked out HackerRank & Exercism. Lastly, I made some progress on the Introduction to Python Programming course I am taking on Edx. Currently I am on the loops chapter 3.3. Below is are some code snippets from that class for some problems I had to solve. 
 
 ```python
 #3.3.5 Coding Excercise 1
 for i in range(1,measures+1):
    for j in range(1,beats_per_measure+1):
        print(j)
 
 #3.3.5 Coding Excercise 2
line_counter = 0 
while line_counter < lines_of_sanity:
    for i in lyrics:
        print(i)
        line_counter += 1
print("MAKE IT STOP") 
 ```

**Thoughts**: I am excited to began my #100DaysOfCode journey. Two main skills I want to focus on is Python & SQL. I may also learn a little bit about Web Dev (HTML,CSS,JS). I have a learning plan created on Trello (See attached link below). I plan on mixing in resources like CodeWars, HackerRank to get additional practice.
